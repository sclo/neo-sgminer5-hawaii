# sgminer

## Introduction

Fork of SGMiner 5 for mining Neoscrypt on Hawaii cards (may be used with others, but it also may suck.)

## Configuration
Example NeoScrypt conf file for 270X, 290X, and 290X (in that order), is in neoscrypt.conf. It is my own.

Oh, and GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR MUST be 0 or undefined.
